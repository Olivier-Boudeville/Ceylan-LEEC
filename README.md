# LEEC: Let's Encrypt Erlang with Ceylan

![](/doc/leec-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all LEEC-related elements.

The purpose of Ceylan-LEEC is to enable Erlang applications such as webservers to obtain the X.509 certificates that they need from ACME servers like the Let's Encrypt ones.

LEEC is a fork of the [Let's Encrypt client library for Erlang](https://github.com/gbour/letsencrypt-erlang) authored by Guillaume Bour.

LEEC is notably used in the context of [US-Web](http://us-web.esperide.org/).

Please refer to the [LEEC official documentation](http://leec.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/Ceylan-LEEC/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to correspond to the current stable version of this library.
