% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-LEEC can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new lib leec', as LEEC is a library
% OTP application (without supervision trees).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
% rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the Ceylan-Myriad OTP library application (Erlang implied):

% As a Git-based dependency:
{deps, [ {myriad, {git, "https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad.git",
					{branch, "master"}}},

		 % Note: the choices done here must be consistent with the ones done in
		 % conf/leec.app.src and with the HTTPC_OPT variable (see
		 % GNUmakevars.inc).

		 % Currently not used, as we prefer relying directly on native httpc
		 % instead:
		 %
		 %{shotgun, "0.5.0"},

		 % One of these two JSON parsers is needed:
		 {jsx, "3.0.0"}
		 %{jiffy , "1.0.8"}

		 % Not used currently:
		 %{elli, "3.3.0"}
				 ] }.


% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% (works if the package uses a specific hook script, see
% hex-compile-hook-script.sh, to compensate for the GNUmake* root files that the
% package archive will not include at their location)
%
%{deps, [ {myriad, "1.0.37"} ] }.


% Include directories found in INC:
%
% (here we favor native_httpc over shotgun, which is consistent with the choices
% in conf/leec.app.src)
